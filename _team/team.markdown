## Our Beginning

Perihelion Technical Labs was founded by a solo developer and researcher focused on creating innovative open-source software. We believe that open-source software helps foster community development, and that collaboration is key. By keeping our software open-source, you too can become a researcher, developer, and contributor to science no-matter how little or how much you can help!

## Our Pledges

Perihelion Technical Labs pledges to keep our software and research as transparent as possible.
Perihelion Technical Labs pledges to keep our software and research free **forever**.
Perihelion Technical Labs will be extremely permissive with our research and software.
